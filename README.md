# GraphGC

This program makes growth curve plots from multiple cell density measurements (at different time points) from multiple strains or replicates. 

(The growth curves are then examined individually to determine how much each culture need to be concentrated for downstream experiments.)

Usage: python graphGC.py data.csv
